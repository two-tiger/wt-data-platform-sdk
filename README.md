# WT Data Platform SDK

<p align="center">
    <a href="README_CN.md">中文</a> &nbsp; | &nbsp; English
</p>

Python SDK for writing, querying, and managing agent trajectory data on the Wind Tunnel data platform. All database operations use dldb, which manages logical partitions on top of LanceDB.

## Install

dldb is installed from the public
[DeepLink-org/Persisting](https://github.com/DeepLink-org/Persisting) repository
at the `dldb-v1.1.2` tag declared in `pyproject.toml`. This version is required
for exact logical-table resolution and unpartitioned SimpleTable reopening.
The supported Python versions are 3.10 through 3.12.

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pip install -e ".[etl]"      # Core SDK plus ETL-only dependencies
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,etl]"  # Full repository development
```

The ETL subsystem is isolated under `wt_sdk/etl/`. Core SDK imports never load
it. Install ETL-specific dependencies only when needed:

ETL v1 currently adds no third-party packages beyond the core SDK stack; the
extra is the required boundary for future ETL-only dependencies.

## Configure Before Integrating

The SDK reads process environment variables when a client is created. Existing application code can keep using WTGatewayClient().

### Use .env locally

Copy [.env.example](.env.example) into the integrating service as .env, replace the placeholders, and keep the real file out of version control.

```bash
# .env
WT_SDK_DB_URI=s3://your-dldb-bucket
WT_SDK_ENV_CONFIG_DB_URI=s3://your-env-config-bucket
WT_SDK_S3_ENDPOINT=http://your-s3-endpoint:8060
WT_SDK_S3_ALLOW_HTTP=true
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=replace-with-your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=replace-with-your-secret-key
AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED=true
WT_SDK_PROFILE=test
```

Load it before starting the application:

```bash
set -a && source .env && set +a
python your_service.py
```

### Export variables directly

For CI, systemd, Kubernetes, or another deployment system, inject the same variables directly:

```bash
export WT_SDK_DB_URI=s3://your-dldb-bucket
export WT_SDK_ENV_CONFIG_DB_URI=s3://your-env-config-bucket
export WT_SDK_S3_ENDPOINT=http://your-s3-endpoint:8060
export WT_SDK_S3_ALLOW_HTTP=true
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=replace-with-your-access-key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=replace-with-your-secret-key
export AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED=true
export WT_SDK_PROFILE=test
python your_service.py
```

Docker Compose can reuse the same .env:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    env_file:
      - .env
```

### Table Profiles

`WT_SDK_PROFILE` selects default logical tables. Explicit `GatewayConfig`
values and method arguments such as `search(table="...")` take precedence.

| Profile | Landing table | Serving table | Environment-config table | ETL checkpoint table (only when ETL runs) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `test` or omitted | `v2_landing_test` | `serving_test` | `env_config_test` | `etl_checkpoints_test` |
| `production` or `prod` | `wind_tunnel_landing` | `wind_tunnel_serving` | `evaluation_env_config` | `wind_tunnel_etl_checkpoints` |

Omitting `WT_SDK_PROFILE` safely defaults to `test`. Production access must be
selected explicitly with `production` or `prod`.

The checkpoint table is stored in a separate ETL database. Only checkpoint
initialization and default incremental ETL require either
`WT_SDK_ETL_STATE_DB_URI=s3://wind-tunnel-etl` or the ETL command's
`--state-db-uri` option. Ordinary SDK clients, upstream writers, and targeted
manual ETL by job/session/time/filter do not require or read this setting.
Missing it does not affect `WT_SDK_PROFILE` resolution. When the ETL state
database is used, the same profile selects the checkpoint table shown above.

`EnvConfigManager` uses the separate `WT_SDK_ENV_CONFIG_DB_URI` database. The
same profile selects `env_config_test` or `evaluation_env_config`; an explicit
`table_name=` overrides the profile, and an explicit `db_uri=` overrides the
environment-config database URI. The endpoint and AWS credentials above are
shared by both databases.
Environment-config reads use `checkout_latest=True` by default so a long-lived
process can see configs committed by another process after it started.
The default is backward-compatible with existing callers; pass
`checkout_latest=False` only when an older snapshot is intentionally acceptable.

## End-to-End Best Practice

The following workflow models one agent evaluation job from raw trajectory
capture to training consumption and searchable serving data. Load credentials
and the table profile through environment variables, then reuse one client
within each process.

### 1. Capture and Finalize a Trajectory

Use `ingest_landing()` for an event that must be persisted immediately and
`ingest_landing_batch()` for buffered events. Generate `id` and `created_at`
upstream; keep `step_id` unique and increasing within a session.

```python
import json
import time
import uuid

from wt_sdk import LandingRecord, WTGatewayClient


def message(role: str, text: str) -> dict:
    return {"role": role, "content": text}


job_id = "evaluation-run-001"       # One evaluation run and HASH partition key
session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())      # One agent trajectory
created_at = int(time.time())


def make_record(step_id: int, terminal: bool = False) -> LandingRecord:
    return LandingRecord(
        id=f"{session_id}:{step_id}",  # Caller-provided and globally unique
        dataset_type="RL",
        job_id=job_id,
        session_id=session_id,
        step_id=step_id,
        created_at=created_at + step_id,
        is_terminal=terminal,
        is_session_completed=terminal,
        # Trajectory payload columns are opaque JSON strings at the SDK boundary.
        messages=json.dumps([message("user", f"task input for step {step_id}")]),
        response=json.dumps(message("assistant", f"result for step {step_id}")),
        meta_json=json.dumps(
            {"task_id": "benchmark-task-42", "group_id": "group-a"}
        ),
    )


first = make_record(1)
buffered = [make_record(2), make_record(3, terminal=True)]
scope = f"job_id = '{job_id}' AND session_id = '{session_id}'"

with WTGatewayClient() as client:
    client.ingest_landing(first)             # Low-latency single write
    client.ingest_landing_batch(buffered)    # Higher-throughput buffered write

    # Reward may arrive after the terminal event has been stored.
    client.update_landing(
        f"{scope} AND step_id = 3",
        {"reward": 1.0, "step_reward": 1.0, "is_trainable": True},
    )  # source_updated_at is refreshed automatically.

    trajectory = client.query_data(
        scope,
        order_by="step_id",
        checkout_latest=True,
        exclude_none=True,  # Default: omit null table columns from each result.
        deserialize_json=True,  # Return JSON columns as dict/list values.
    )
    first_step_id = trajectory[0]["step_id"]  # query_data() returns List[dict].
    job_row_count = client.count_landing(partition=job_id)

    # Prefer this pruned lookup when both job_id and id are known.
    exact_event = client.query_data(
        f"job_id = '{job_id}' AND id = '{buffered[-1].id}'",
        limit=1,
    )
```

`query_data()` returns plain dictionaries and omits null table columns by
default; pass `exclude_none=False` when a complete schema-shaped payload is
required. JSON columns remain JSON strings by default and are never modified by
`exclude_none`; pass `deserialize_json=True` to return their documents as Python
`dict`/`list` values. Deserialization does not remove nulls inside JSON.

```python
deserialize_json=False  # LanceDB-native output: JSON strings (default).
deserialize_json=True   # SDK applies json.loads(): Python dict/list values.
```

`messages`, `response`, `chosen_trace`, `rejected_trace`, and `meta_json` use
Arrow `json<string>` in both landing and serving. Callers serialize the entire
JSON document with `json.dumps()` before ingestion. A trace is therefore a JSON
array encoded as one string, not an Arrow `list<struct>`. The SDK deliberately
does not enforce an OpenAI or provider-specific document shape; landing may keep
provider-native raw data in `meta_json`, while ETL writes normalized OpenAI-style
payload JSON into serving.

### SDK-managed timestamps

| Field | Unit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `created_at` | Existing caller-defined unit | Original trajectory creation time; immutable after ingestion. |
| `source_updated_at` | Unix epoch milliseconds | Last substantive source change that may affect ETL/serving output. Automatically initialized and refreshed by landing updates. |
| `serving_updated_at` | Unix epoch milliseconds | Last successful serving ingest/upsert publication. Always null in landing. |

Callers may provide `source_updated_at` when replaying or migrating records;
otherwise `LandingRecord`/`ServingRecord` initializes it. Serving writes preserve
that source value and stamp a fresh `serving_updated_at` on an internal copy, so
the caller's model is not mutated.

### 2. Consume Completed Events

A long-running trainer pulls one page at a time and saves the cursor only after
that page is processed successfully. `pull_data()` adds the `dataset_type`
filter; keep `job_id` in `where_sql` for HASH pruning. The placeholder
`load_checkpoint()`, `process_page()`, and `save_checkpoint()` calls below belong
to the consuming application; scope each durable checkpoint by consumer and
query/table identity.

```python
job_filter = "job_id = 'evaluation-run-001' AND is_terminal = True"
page_size = 1000
stored_cursor = load_checkpoint()  # Return None when no checkpoint exists.

with WTGatewayClient() as client:
    while True:
        page = client.pull_data(
            dataset_type="RL",
            where_sql=job_filter,
            cursor=stored_cursor,
            limit=page_size,
            checkout_latest=True,
            deserialize_json=True,
        )
        if page.empty:
            break

        process_page(page)
        next_cursor = client.extract_cursor(page)
        save_checkpoint(next_cursor)  # Persist only after processing succeeds.
        stored_cursor = next_cursor

        if len(page) < page_size:
            break

    # Optional: inspect the current high-water mark for this pull scope.
    latest_record = client.get_max_created_at(
        where_sql=f"dataset_type = 'RL' AND {job_filter}",
    )
```

`get_max_created_at()` is a cursor/watermark helper for `pull_data()` workflows,
not a separate data-retrieval mode. It is useful for initialization, monitoring,
or recovery checks; normal page advancement should still persist the cursor from
`extract_cursor(page)` only after the page is processed successfully.

For a convenient one-run scan or backfill, `iter_data_batches()` manages the
`created_at` cursor and yields DataFrame batches lazily:

```python
with WTGatewayClient() as client:
    for batch in client.iter_data_batches(
        dataset_type="RL",
        where_sql="job_id = 'evaluation-run-001'",
        chunk_size=1000,
        deserialize_json=True,
    ):
        print(f"received {len(batch)} rows")
```

`pull_data()` and `iter_data_batches()` keep landing as their default. External
consumers can pass `table=client.config.tables.serving_table`. Consumers that
need Python payload objects should also pass `deserialize_json=True` and handle
ordinary `dict/list` values rather than the former Arrow nested containers. Both
APIs use a `created_at` cursor, so they are not the formal export path when
multiple rows can share a timestamp.

### 3. Publish Enriched Data

After ETL or training selection, publish enriched records to serving. Landing
and serving use the same schema; fields that have not been enriched yet remain
null in landing. Vector search is not currently exposed.

```python
from wt_sdk import ServingRecord

serving_data = buffered[-1].model_dump()
serving_data.update(
    reward=1.0,
    step_reward=1.0,
    is_trainable=True,
    search_text="benchmark task final successful response",
    tags=["trainable", "successful"],
)
serving_record = ServingRecord(**serving_data)

with WTGatewayClient() as client:
    # ETL publication should be retryable and race-free.
    client.upsert_serving(serving_record)
    published = client.get_by_id(
        serving_record.id,
        exclude_none=True,
        deserialize_json=True,
    )
    assert published and published["id"] == serving_record.id

    matches = client.search(
        "successful",
        dataset_type="RL",
        tags=["trainable"],
        limit=20,
        deserialize_json=True,
    )
```

`get_by_id()` queries serving by default, or exactly the named `table`; it does
not fall back across the internal/external table boundary. Because an ID alone
cannot identify a HASH bucket, prefer `query_data()` with both `job_id` and `id`
on hot landing paths. Like `query_data()`, it returns a plain dictionary and
omits null table columns by default without modifying JSON strings.

ETL should publish complete records through `upsert_serving()` or
`upsert_serving_batch()`. These methods call dldb's native upsert path with
`columns=["job_id", "id"]` by default; pass `match_columns=` to override the
dldb merge keys when an explicit upstream key contract requires it. Do not
implement a query-then-ingest/update sequence. Repeated upserts converge to the
same business content, while `serving_updated_at`
records the most recent successful publication and may therefore change on a
retry. Every upsert record requires a non-empty, immutable `job_id`. dldb HASH
tables do not provide a uniqueness constraint across buckets, so callers should
keep IDs globally unique and must never move an existing ID to another `job_id`.
The append/add `ingest_serving(_batch)` methods remain available and
also stamp `serving_updated_at`.

The repository now includes the ETL v1 engine, durable per-bucket checkpoints,
manual backfill modes, and the built-in chosen-trace/tag stages. Contributors
must follow the stage contract and integration guide in
[`wt_sdk/etl/README_STAGE_DEVELOPMENT.md`](wt_sdk/etl/README_STAGE_DEVELOPMENT.md);
runtime and operational guidance remains in
[`wt_sdk/etl/README.md`](wt_sdk/etl/README.md).

List the registered pipelines without connecting to any database:

```bash
python -m wt_sdk.etl.cli.run --list-pipelines
```

For a formal offline export after serving data has been published, use
`export_data_batches()`. It defaults to serving, captures a complete unique-ID
manifest before yielding the first batch, and then validates every exact-ID
batch. Rows appended after manifest capture are excluded; duplicate IDs or source
rows deleted/changed so they no longer match cause a hard failure instead of
silent loss:

`export_data_batches()` requires a Python runtime built with standard-library
`sqlite3` support. No external SQLite service or additional pip package is
required.

```python
with WTGatewayClient() as client:
    for batch in client.export_data_batches(
        filter_query="dataset_type = 'RL' AND is_trainable = True",
        batch_size=5000,
        columns=["id", "job_id", "chosen_trace", "tags", "meta_json"],
    ):
        write_to_temporary_export(batch)

    publish_completed_export()
```

Treat serving rows selected for an export as immutable until iteration completes,
and publish a file only after the iterator is exhausted successfully. dldb does
not expose one atomic snapshot across all physical HASH buckets, so this manifest
and validation protocol provides a stable row set but cannot preserve pre-update
field values if a selected row is modified during export.

### 4. Maintain Incremental Indexes

Do not build indexes in the synchronous writer path. After a job finishes, or
from a background operations process, refresh only the bucket touched by that
job:

```python
with WTGatewayClient() as client:
    summary = client.maintain_table_indexes(
        "wind_tunnel_landing",
        partitions=["evaluation-run-001"],
    )
```

This creates missing configured indexes and runs dldb optimize so appended rows
enter existing indexes. Use `all_partitions=True` only for scheduled full-table
maintenance. The context manager closes the dldb session and emits its final
metrics summary when enabled.

### Choosing a Data Read API

| API | Accepted parameters | Return type | Pagination control | Default table | Best suited for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query_data()` | `filter_query`, `limit`, `columns`, `partition`, `order_by`, `ascending`, `checkout_latest`, `table`, `exclude_none`, `deserialize_json` | One `List[dict]` | No cursor management; one query with optional `limit` | Landing | Interactive filtering, trajectory/detail lookup, Dashboard lists, small bounded result sets |
| `get_by_id()` | `record_id`, `table`, `exclude_none`, `deserialize_json` | One `dict`, or `None` | None; scans the selected table because ID cannot locate a HASH bucket | Serving | Occasional lookup when only a globally unique ID is known |
| `pull_data()` | `dataset_type`, `where_sql`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `cursor`, `order_by`, `ascending`, `limit`, `checkout_latest`, `table`, `deserialize_json` | One DataFrame page | Caller supplies, extracts, and persists the `created_at` cursor | Landing | Incremental consumers, polling, retryable processing, durable checkpoints |
| `iter_data_batches()` | `dataset_type`, `where_sql`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `chunk_size`, `order_by`, `ascending`, `table`, `deserialize_json` | Iterator yielding one DataFrame per batch | SDK advances the `created_at` cursor internally until exhausted | Landing | Convenient one-run scans, backfills, and offline processing where timestamp ties are acceptable |
| `export_data_batches()` | `filter_query`, `batch_size`, `columns`, `table`, `deserialize_json` | Iterator yielding one validated DataFrame per manifest batch | SDK first captures a complete unique-ID manifest, then fetches and verifies exact IDs | Serving | Formal offline exports requiring a fixed row set, duplicate-ID detection, and no timestamp-cursor gaps |
| `search()` | `query`, `limit`, `tags`, `where_sql`, `dataset_type`, `stream`, `table`, `deserialize_json`, `checkout_latest` | One DataFrame, or a one-frame iterator with `stream=True` | One bounded search | Serving | Dashboard keyword search over `search_text`, with tags and scalar filters; LIKE metacharacters are literal and latest snapshot is the default |

`query_data()`, `pull_data()`, and `iter_data_batches()` default to landing and
accept `table=client.config.tables.serving_table`. `get_by_id()`, `search()`, and
`export_data_batches()` default to serving. Include `job_id` in filters whenever
possible for HASH bucket pruning.

`query_data()` and `get_by_id()` omit null table columns by default. Pass
`exclude_none=False` to retain them. All row-returning read APIs keep JSON as
strings by default; `deserialize_json=True` returns Python values while
preserving JSON-internal nulls. Malformed JSON remains unchanged as a string so
a presentation option cannot make an otherwise readable row fail.

Within one `WTGatewayClient` lifetime, dldb 1.1.2 resolves the exact
information-schema record and reuses its logical-table wrapper and opened
physical bucket objects. The SDK does not reconstruct or pin dldb wrappers.
This applies to reads, writes, index maintenance, and scripts built on the
client; it does not cache query results or change `checkout_latest`. Code that
mutates the logical catalog through `client.session` must call
`client.invalidate_table_cache(table_name)` before the next SDK operation.

## Client Interface

### Landing Data

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| ingest_landing(record) | Write one LandingRecord. |
| ingest_landing_batch(records) | Write a list of records or LandingRecordBatch. |
| upsert_landing(record, *, match_columns=None) / upsert_landing_batch(records, *, match_columns=None) | Upsert complete landing rows through dldb; defaults to `job_id` + `id` matching and passes selected keys through to dldb. |
| query_data(filter_query, ..., table=None, exclude_none=True, deserialize_json=False) | Query landing by default, or a named table; always return `List[dict]`. |
| update_landing(filter_query, updates, ..., touch_source_updated_at=True) | Patch matching rows and refresh `source_updated_at` by default. SDK timestamps, `id`, `created_at`, and `job_id` are protected. |
| count_landing(partition=None) | Count rows, optionally in one raw job_id or hash bucket. |
| delete_landing(filter_query) | Delete matching landing records. |

query_data() and update_landing() accept a raw partition="job-id" for compatibility. On HASH tables the SDK converts it to the bucket and adds a job_id predicate. Prefer putting job_id in filter_query explicitly.

For an ordered or limited landing query, include job_id in filter_query. Cross-bucket order_by + limit is not a global merge sort in the current dldb partition model.

```python
with WTGatewayClient() as client:
    latest = client.query_data(
        "job_id = 'job-001' AND session_id = 'session-001'",
        order_by="step_id",
        ascending=False,
        limit=1,
    )
    result = client.update_landing(
        "job_id = 'job-001' AND session_id = 'session-001' AND step_id = 1",
        {"is_terminal": True, "is_trainable": True},
    )
```

Existing `update_landing()` calls require no changes: the new keyword-only
`touch_source_updated_at` defaults to `True`. Updates to `is_trainable`, payloads,
rewards, `meta_json`, `agent_model`, or any enrichment consumed by serving must
keep that default, including in-place landing ETL. Use
`touch_source_updated_at=False` only for a purely operational/diagnostic patch
that cannot affect any downstream result. The ETL engine should avoid calling
update when values did not actually change. `update_landing()` returns caller
fields in `updated_fields` and submitted fields in `effective_updated_fields`;
dldb does not yet return exact matched or updated counts across logical
partitions.

### Serving, Search, and Pagination

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| ingest_serving(record) / ingest_serving_batch(records) | Append processed serving records and stamp `serving_updated_at`. |
| upsert_serving(record, *, match_columns=None) / upsert_serving_batch(records, *, match_columns=None) | ETL publication by dldb match keys (default `job_id` + `id`); preserve `source_updated_at` and refresh `serving_updated_at`. |
| query_data(filter_query, ..., table=serving_table, exclude_none=True, deserialize_json=False) | Query serving with the same filtering and HASH pruning behavior; always return `List[dict]`. |
| count_serving(partition=None) / delete_serving(filter_query) | Operate on serving data. |
| search(query, ..., deserialize_json=False, checkout_latest=True) | Search serving `search_text`, optionally constrained by tags/SQL filters; user `%`, `_`, and `\\` characters are treated literally. |
| get_tags_distribution() | Return serving tag frequencies. |
| get_by_id(record_id, table=None, exclude_none=True, deserialize_json=False) | Return one compact dictionary from serving by default, or exactly one named table. |
| pull_data(..., table=None, deserialize_json=False) / iter_data_batches(..., table=None, deserialize_json=False) | Read landing by default, or a named table, with manual-page or automatic-batch iteration. |
| export_data_batches(filter_query="", ..., table=None, deserialize_json=False) | Reliably export a fixed ID manifest from serving by default; validates each exact-ID batch. |

Vector search is not currently exposed by dldb. Keyword search always targets
the ETL-generated `search_text`; tags, dataset type, and normal SQL conditions
remain available as filters. `stream=True` returns an iterator containing the
current result frame.

### Environment Configs

Environment configs live in the separate database selected by
`WT_SDK_ENV_CONFIG_DB_URI`. `WT_SDK_PROFILE` selects `env_config_test` for test
or `evaluation_env_config` for production. An explicit `table_name=` overrides
the profile. Read APIs default to `checkout_latest=True` so a long-lived gateway
process can see configs written by a launcher process after the gateway started.

```python
from wt_sdk import EnvConfigManager

test_envs = EnvConfigManager()  # test is the safe default
production_envs = EnvConfigManager(profile="production")
explicit_envs = EnvConfigManager(table_name="evaluation_env_config")
```

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `get_env_configs(limit, offset=0, filter_query="", *, checkout_latest=True)` | Page through configs with an optional SQL filter. |
| `get_all_env_configs(*, checkout_latest=True)` | Return all configs sorted by `id`. |
| `get_env_image_map(*, checkout_latest=True)` | Build `env_name -> image` from the latest config table snapshot. |
| `get_all_image(*, checkout_latest=True)` | Build `image -> env_name` from rows with non-empty images. |
| `count(filter_query="", *, checkout_latest=True)` | Count configs, optionally matching a SQL filter. |

### Index Maintenance

`maintain_table_indexes()` accepts one of the two production or two test table
names. The exact table name selects the landing or serving index definitions.
Callers must provide raw job IDs/HASH bucket integers or `all_partitions=True`;
the method creates missing indexes and runs dldb optimize by default.

The two unpartitioned environment-config tables use their own database and
maintenance command. The default database URI is
`s3://wind-tunnel-env-config`, overridden by `WT_SDK_ENV_CONFIG_DB_URI` or
`--db-uri`. Inspect production fragment and index health without modifying the
table:

```bash
python scripts/inspect/show_env_config_status.py --profile production
python scripts/inspect/show_env_config_status.py --profile production --json
```

The report includes row/byte counts, fragment statistics, configured versus
existing indexes, and indexed/unindexed row coverage. Run a read-only
maintenance preview first, then create missing configured indexes and perform
full table maintenance:

```bash
python scripts/ops/maintain_env_config_indexes.py --dry-run
python scripts/ops/maintain_env_config_indexes.py

python scripts/ops/maintain_env_config_indexes.py \
  --profile production --dry-run
python scripts/ops/maintain_env_config_indexes.py \
  --profile production
```

By default the command calls dldb's full `optimize()`: it compacts fragments,
cleans old versions according to dldb's retention policy, and refreshes index
coverage. Use `--no-optimize` only when the operation should create missing
indexes without the full maintenance pass.

## Timing and Metrics

```bash
WT_SDK_DLDB_MODEL=metrics
WT_SDK_LOG_DLDB_TIMING=1
WT_SDK_DLDB_METRICS_LOG=./wt_metrics_log.jsonl
```

In metrics mode, client.close() returns the dldb session summary and appends per-call events plus a summary event to the configured JSONL file.

## Run Tests

### Unit tests

Unit tests use fakes and do not connect to S3 or dldb:

```bash
pytest -q
```

The timing test writes a readable JSONL example to the ignored
`tests/artifacts/metrics_log.txt`.

### Real DLDB/S3 integration tests

Integration tests write a few uniquely scoped rows to the existing `v2_landing_test`
and `serving_test` tables, then clean and verify them in `finally`. They target
these explicit test tables independently of `WT_SDK_PROFILE`; `WT_SDK_DB_URI`
chooses the database. Both tables must use the current `HASH(job_id)` schema.

```bash
set -a && source .env && set +a
WT_SDK_RUN_INTEGRATION=1 python -m pytest -q tests/integration

# ETL-only real integration tests
WT_SDK_RUN_INTEGRATION=1 python -m pytest -q wt_sdk/etl/tests/integration
```

WT_SDK_RUN_INTEGRATION=1 is a pytest safety switch, not an SDK runtime setting.

## Operational Scripts

Load the same .env before running scripts:

```bash
set -a && source .env && set +a
```

### Table Management

```bash
# List logical tables
python scripts/ops/table_manager.py list

# List another dldb database
python scripts/ops/table_manager.py list --db-uri s3://my-dldb-bucket

# Inspect schema, partition metadata, and scalar indexes
python scripts/ops/table_manager.py show-schema wind_tunnel_landing

# List physical dldb/Lance tables behind a logical table
python scripts/ops/table_manager.py show-physical v2_landing_test

# Inspect the production environment-config table
python scripts/ops/table_manager.py show-schema evaluation_env_config \
  --db-uri "$WT_SDK_ENV_CONFIG_DB_URI"

# Environment-config initialization defaults to the test profile and is destructive
python scripts/ops/init_evaluation_env_table.py --dry-run
python scripts/ops/init_evaluation_env_table.py --confirm-recreate

# Production requires an explicit profile as well as destructive confirmation
python scripts/ops/init_evaluation_env_table.py \
  --profile production --dry-run

# Interactive delete: type the exact table name, then DROP
python scripts/ops/table_manager.py drop v2_landing_test

# Non-interactive delete: repeat the exact target
python scripts/ops/table_manager.py drop v2_landing_test \
  --force --confirm-table v2_landing_test

# Delete one HASH bucket from a disposable test table
python scripts/ops/table_manager.py drop serving_test --partition 42
```

### Query and Inspect Data

`--query` accepts a standard SQL `WHERE` predicate without the leading
`WHERE`. Use normal SQL operators such as `=`, `IN (...)`, `LIKE`, `AND`,
`OR`, comparison operators, and boolean literals. Wrap the whole predicate in
shell quotes so spaces and `%` patterns are passed to the script unchanged.
For the four active landing/serving tables, exact `job_id = '...'` predicates
use SDK HASH bucket pruning. Filtered queries and filtered `--count` do not
compute the full table size by default; add `--with-total-count` only when you
really need that slower full-table count.
Use `--distinct` to list unique values or unique column combinations; it reads
only the selected columns and computes uniqueness in the script.

```bash
# Count rows
python scripts/inspect/query_data.py --table wind_tunnel_landing --count

# Count one exact job_id using HASH bucket pruning
python scripts/inspect/query_data.py --table wind_tunnel_landing \
  --query "job_id = 'job-001'" --count

# List all distinct job IDs and their count
python scripts/inspect/query_data.py --table wind_tunnel_landing \
  --distinct job_id

# Count distinct sessions inside one job without printing every value
python scripts/inspect/query_data.py --table wind_tunnel_landing \
  --query "job_id = 'job-001'" \
  --distinct session_id \
  --count

# List distinct job/session combinations and dump them to JSON
python scripts/inspect/query_data.py --table wind_tunnel_landing \
  --query "job_id LIKE '%panjia%'" \
  --distinct "job_id,session_id" \
  --output ./artifacts/panjia_distinct_sessions.json

# Query the test environment-config table; both env table names automatically
# use WT_SDK_ENV_CONFIG_DB_URI
python scripts/inspect/query_data.py --table env_config_test \
  --query "job_id = 'job-001'" \
  --columns "id,job_id,env_id,env_name,group_id,finished" \
  --limit 20

# Count production environment configs for one job
python scripts/inspect/query_data.py --table evaluation_env_config \
  --query "job_id = 'job-001'" --count

# Dump environment configs to a local JSON file
python scripts/inspect/query_data.py --table evaluation_env_config \
  --query "job_id = 'job-001'" \
  --output ./artifacts/job_001_env_configs.json

# Query selected columns
python scripts/inspect/query_data.py --table v2_landing_test \
  --query "job_id = 'job-001'" --columns "id,session_id,step_id,is_terminal"

# Count rows matching a SQL filter
python scripts/inspect/query_data.py --table wind_tunnel_landing \
  --query "job_id LIKE '%panjia%' AND is_trainable = true" --count

# Decode and inspect JSON payload columns without display truncation
python scripts/inspect/query_data.py --table v2_landing_test --limit 1 \
  --show-nested --no-truncate

# Dump one sample row to a local JSON file, expanding JSON payload columns
python scripts/inspect/query_data.py --table v2_landing_test \
  --query "job_id = 'job-001'" --limit 1 \
  --output ./artifacts/landing_job_001_sample.json

# Dump selected production rows to a local JSON file
python scripts/inspect/query_data.py --table wind_tunnel_landing \
  --query "job_id LIKE '%panjia%' AND is_trainable = true" \
  --columns "id,job_id,session_id,step_id,source_updated_at" \
  --output ./artifacts/panjia_trainable_rows.json

# Show expected versus existing scalar indexes by partition
python scripts/inspect/show_table_indexes.py v2_landing_test

# Show aggregate fragment statistics and index coverage for selected HASH buckets
python scripts/inspect/show_partition_status.py --table v2_landing_test \
  --partition 34 --partition 94

# Inspect every logical bucket, including buckets that have not materialized yet
python scripts/inspect/show_partition_status.py \
  --table wind_tunnel_landing --all-partitions

# Column definitions and STATE meanings are documented in scripts/README.md.

# Scan a logical table for duplicate IDs
python scripts/inspect/scan_duplicate_id.py --table v2_landing_test --max-output 100

# Legacy diagnostic for payload decode failures in pre-JSON-schema data
python scripts/inspect/scan_landing_nested_decode.py --table v2_landing_test

# Inspect serving tags and ETL-generated search text
python scripts/inspect/get_unique_tags.py --table wind_tunnel_serving
python scripts/inspect/check_search_text.py --table wind_tunnel_serving
```

### Cleanup and Indexes

Filtered cleanup on the four active landing/serving tables uses SDK HASH
bucket pruning for exact `job_id = '...'` predicates and only reads lightweight
preview/count columns during dry-runs.

```bash
# Preview matching landing data before deletion
python scripts/ops/cleanup_data.py --table v2_landing_test \
  --query "job_id = 'job-001'" --dry-run

# Delete matching test data
python scripts/ops/cleanup_data.py --table v2_landing_test \
  --query "job_id = 'job-001'"

# Preview dirty test env config rows; this table automatically uses WT_SDK_ENV_CONFIG_DB_URI
python scripts/ops/cleanup_data.py --table env_config_test \
  --query "job_id = 'gateway'" --dry-run

# Delete dirty test env config rows after preview
python scripts/ops/cleanup_data.py --table env_config_test \
  --query "job_id = 'gateway'"

# Preview and patch filtered landing rows in the test profile
python scripts/ops/update_table_rows.py --profile test --table landing \
  --query "job_id = 'job-001' AND session_id = 'session-001'" \
  --updates '{"is_session_completed": true}' --dry-run

# Patch filtered serving rows in production (exact-table confirmation required)
python scripts/ops/update_table_rows.py --profile prod --table serving \
  --query "job_id = 'job-001' AND id = 'record-001'" \
  --updates '{"is_session_completed": true}'

# Create missing indexes and optimize every existing landing bucket
python scripts/ops/maintain_table_indexes.py \
  --table wind_tunnel_landing --all-partitions

# Create missing indexes and optimize every existing serving bucket
python scripts/ops/maintain_table_indexes.py \
  --table wind_tunnel_serving --all-partitions
```

`update_table_rows.py` only targets the active landing/serving table selected
by `--profile`; it does not accept custom or legacy table names. It skips rows
already at the requested values, refreshes the role-specific SDK timestamp,
and reports the row count confirmed by a latest-snapshot read after the update.

scripts/dev contains disposable test-table setup helpers. scripts/migrations contains completed historical migrations and is not routine setup. See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for the full layout.
